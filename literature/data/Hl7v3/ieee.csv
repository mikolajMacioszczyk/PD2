HL7 messaging standards are widely implemented by the healthcare industry and have been deployed internationally for decades. HL7 Version 2 (“v2”) health information exchange standards are a popular choice of local hospital communities for the exchange of healthcare information, including electronic medical record information. In development for 15 years, HL7 Version 3 (“v3”) was designed to be the successor to Version 2, addressing Version 2's shortcomings. HL7 v3 has been heavily criticized by the industry for being internally inconsistent even in it's own documentation, too complex and expensive to implement in real world systems and has been accused of contributing towards many failed and stalled systems implementations. HL7 is now experimenting with a new approach to the development of standards with FHIR. This research provides a chronicle of the evolution of the HL7 messaging standards, an introduction to HL7 FHIR and a comparative analysis between HL7 FHIR and previous HL7 messaging standards.","1063-7125","978-1-4799-1053-3","10.1109/CBMS.2013.6627810","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6627810","eHealth;Interoperability;Healthcare;Standards;FHIR;HL7 v3;Agile;RESTful;Informatics","Interoperability;Object oriented modeling;Software;Hospitals;Standards organizations","","307","","18","IEEE","10 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the heels of HL7's successful version 2, the last version 3, including the RIM, which forms its centerpiece, has received significant attention, but it has in turn also been subjected to criticism, addressing important questions about the usability in specialist domains. The RIM defines `normative' classes such as Act, Role, Entity, etc. each of which is associated with a rich stock of attributes. When the RIM is applied to a new domain, one then needs to select and code these attributes. This paper reports the exploratory efforts that have been made to evaluate the feasibility of representing clinical engineering information in the HL7 RIM, with the purpose of developing a new HL7 v3 RIM based domain information model (DIM) dedicated to clinical engineering. This paper describes specifically the domain information analysis and the modeling phases of the proposed clinical engineering DIM development, using the Unified Modeling Language (UML). The proposed approach follows the reuse of standard healthcare information models for representation of clinical engineering information model, basing on the UML extensibility mechanisms and providing several advantages such us tooling support, graphical notation, exchangeability, extensibility, etc., which are also deployable in the next generation of HL7 tools.","","978-1-4244-4998-9","10.1109/WHCM.2010.5441265","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5441265","Healthcare modeling;Software standards;Communication standards","Clinical diagnosis;Object oriented modeling;Medical services;Terminology;Unified modeling language;Costs;Information analysis;Technology management;Communication system control;Usability","","1","","9","IEEE","1 Apr 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Interoperability of Medical Device Information and the Clinical Applications: An HL7 RMIM based on the ISO/IEEE 11073 DIM","M. Yuksel; A.

Their benefits will increase if clinical software applications can seamlessly acquire the medical device data. The need to represent medical device observations in a format that can be consumable by clinical applications has already been recognized by the industry. Yet, the solutions proposed involve bilateral mappings from the ISO/IEEE 11073 Domain Information Model (DIM) to specific message or document standards. Considering that there are many different types of clinical applications such as the electronic health record and the personal health record systems, the clinical workflows, and the clinical decision support systems each conforming to different standard interfaces, detailing a mapping mechanism for every one of them introduces significant work and, thus, limits the potential health benefits of medical devices. In this paper, to facilitate the interoperability of clinical applications and the medical device data, we use the ISO/IEEE 11073 DIM to derive an HL7 v3 Refined Message Information Model (RMIM) of the medical device domain from the HL7 v3 Reference Information Mode (RIM). This makes it possible to trace the medical device data back to a standard common denominator, that is, HL7 v3 RIM from which all the other medical domains under HL7 v3 are derived. Hence, once the medical device data are obtained in the RMIM format, it can easily be transformed into HL7-based standard interfaces through XML transformations because these interfaces all have their building blocks from the same RIM. To demonstrate this, we provide the mappings from the developed RMIM to some of the widely used HL7 v3-based standard interfaces.","1558-0032","","10.1109/TITB.2011.2151868","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5764832","Clinical applications;ISO/IEEE 11073 Domain Information Model (DIM);HL7 Reference Information Model (RIM);medical devices;electronic health record (EHR) systems;personal health record (PHR) systems","Measurement;ISO standards;Medical services;Object oriented modeling;Data models;Blood pressure","Computer Communication Networks;Electronic Health Records;Equipment and Supplies;Health Level Seven;Humans;Medical Informatics;Software;Systems Integration","45","","42","IEEE","10 May 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, efficient implementation for optimal, high-end SI entails the abridgement of verbose v3 Message paradigm representations, whilst strictly maintaining their semantic nuance and flavour. The resulting economised structures termed Green Messages, have to be truly universally overarching, affording and facilitating International Interoperability.

This need is addressed in HL7 v3 by providing a number of normative transport specification profiles. Furthermore, there are storyboards describing HL7 v3 message choreographies between specific roles in specific events. Having alternative transport protocols and descriptive message choreographies introduces great flexibility in implementing HL7 standards, yet, this brings in the need for test frameworks that can accommodate different protocols and permit the dynamic definition of test scenarios.

There exist different healthcare enterprise standards that are used for the communication of medical information across health enterprises providing swift and reliable results. HL7 is one of those standards that are used for the exchange of medical information between healthcare systems. The main focus of this research work is to make metadata processing efficient in HL7 v3. HL7 v3 is an emerging standard to achieve semantic interoperability with its well defined information models like reference information model (RIM), domain message information model (D-MIM), and refined message information model (R-MIM). These models are converted to some technology specific format for implementation such as model interchange format (MIF). This format includes metadata information in the form of XML. MIFs are required to load into memory for generation and parsing of messages. HL7 Java SIG API utilizes these files in a non-efficient manner, as it loads all associations (no matter these are required or not) present in a particular MIF file. This is not only the performance issue but also memory wastage. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to improve the process of message generation and parsing by avoiding unnecessary associations during MIF loading. This technique is based on proxy design pattern. The proposed technique removes the performance bottleneck of the API and makes it space efficient.","","978-1-4244-5630-7","10.1109/ICET.2009.5353154","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5353154","","Standards development;Medical services;XML;Java;Communication standards;Educational institutions;Mechanical engineering;Computer science;Formal specifications;Guidelines","","","","12","IEEE","11 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because the quality of the hospital information system (HIS) varies in each institution, it is difficult to judge whether the transmitted data match with the standards completely. If there is any mistake in the exchanged data, it will cause problems to the whole information system as well as to patient records. It is necessary to have a validation mechanism to verify the integrity of the data before data exchange.

A disease is considered rare when it affects only a small percentage of the population, most rare diseases are genetic. Researching rare hereditary diseases imposes several significant challenges for dedicated informatics tools. Collaboration is a critical element in the research process, and partnerships among research centers are essential to ensure advances in understanding and treating these diseases. Because a single research center usually lacks sufficient data for conducting meaningful research, data must be shared among partners. Consequently, the first challenge of the underlying platform is to merge information gathered from dispersed hospitals, research centers, clinics, labs and other facilities. Additionally, various data types such as clinical, genomic, imaging data, and pedigrees, must be combined to create a comprehensive disease view. Obtaining and visualizing all the available data is the first step toward gaining insights through analytics. Research questions cannot always be known in advance and tend to change over time; therefore, an effective platform should be able to integrate various data mining and analytic algorithms. Platform Architecture: We designed BioMIMS based on Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) principles. The BioMIMS architecture is composed of a rich set of fine-grained services decoupled by a central bus. The bus orchestrates the existing services according to predefined workflows, following the Message Oriented Middleware (MOM) concept. Message queues provide temporary storage when the destination service is busy or not connected. All the messages running through the bus and handled by the different services are based on approved industry standards. Medical images are uploaded to and retrieved from the appropriate system service in DICOM v3.0 format, while clinical and family history data are uploaded and retrieved according to HL7 v2.x and HL7 v3 Family History standards. Patients may have different patient identifiers in different systems. To ensure the correct identification of patients and their data in a standard manner, BioMIMS supports IHE Patient Identifier Cross-Reference (PIX) and Patient Demographic Query (PDQ) transactions. To enable interoperability at the cross-hospital and regional levels, metadata are extracted from the stored information according to IHE Cross-enterprise Document Sharing (XDS/XDS-I) Profiles. A SOA approach, based on standard interfaces has numerous benefits, namely: a) a flexible architecture that allows easy integration of new services, creation of new workflows by reusing existing ones, and easy integration with existing applications, b) inherent scalability, c) speedy custom application development that reduces total IT costs. Platform Validation: BioMIMS was validated by researchers of the Rizzoli Orthopaedic Institute (IOR). IOR researchers uploaded and investigated data for two different orthopedic diseases -- Multiple Osteochondromas (MO) and Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) The researchers confirmed several presumed insights for the available data using BioMIMS. Moreover, a few interesting points arose during the validation process, helping to determine goals for future studies.","2166-0786","978-1-61284-415-2","10.1109/SRII.2011.19","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5958075","service oriented architecture;healthcare standards;medical imaging;data mining;data integration;data analytics;rare hereditary diseases;services management;research;pedigree analysis;message oriented middleware","Diseases;DICOM;History;Standards;Genetics;Hospitals","","2","","20","IEEE","18 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the complexity of such technologies difficults their full adoption as well as the migration from centralized healthcare environments into pervasive ones. Aiming at collaborating to bridge this gap, this paper proposes an approach to integrate archetypes into HL7 v3 messages for the development of pervasive healthcare applications.

It has been proposed to provide a consistent API for the HL7v3 CDA. However, the core issues of HL7v3 are not solved at the API level. The community around the project are proposing the adoption of RDF technologies to overcome the current challenges in interoperating with linked data. However, RDF triples nor ontologies provide semantic interoperability by themselves, a more robust information infrastructure, such as the Multilevel Model-Driven (MMD) approach, is required. An XML implementation of the MMD was used to model the FHIR Schemas as Domain Models (DMs) against a generic Reference Model (RM) to provide syntactic validation. RDF triples were included in the domain models to provide missing semantics. The XML data instances were validated against their Domain Models. The DMs do not create any new types, they only express constraints of the RM types, this provides consistent query and data analysis capability across all DMs. RDF triples were extracted from the DMs and added to a triple store graph with the RM ontology. The XML data is also expressed as Literals in the graph. This study shows the feasibility of using MMD solutions to provide full operational semantic interoperability for the FHIR ecosystem.","","978-1-4673-9548-9","10.1109/ICHI.2015.74","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7349736","Health information systems;Information exchange;Health Level 7","Semantics;Medical services;Resource description framework;XML;Interoperability;Data models;Charge coupled devices","","11","","12","IEEE","10 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many organizations are betting on the ability of standards to provide unprecedented end-to-end systems interoperability with partner organizations. Our experience suggests that the expectation of what can be achieved with standards is too high. For example, many large health care providers assume that moving to a new version of a major health care standard (HL7 3.0 and the associated reference information models) will guarantee ""seamless"" interoperability across all health care systems inside the enterprise. However, this new standard does not take into account clinical workflows and operational contexts that differ across point-of care systems and have a large effect on how accurately clinicians interpret data. This paper offers a caution, not that standards are not useful but that organizations need to be aware of limitations of standards they are adopting to achieve systems interoperability. After discussing these limitations, we present some strategies to minimize their effect.","","978-0-7695-3091-8","10.1109/ICCBSS.2008.25","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4464021","standards system-of-systems interoperability","Standards organizations;Medical services;Web services;Software systems;Software standards;Instruments;Internet;Protocols;Computer languages;Software engineering","","52","","16","IEEE","7 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to enable large volume of data to be described in such a way that their meaning can be exploited by machines and, thus, semantic queries and automatic inferential procedures can be enabled, this paper presents an automatic method to derive OWL ontologies from XML schemas. The main contribution of this method relies on the possibility of producing a target ontology starting from multiple XML schemas, by discriminating between domain and cross-domain entities and, contextually, simplifying the overall structure of the final ontology generated, i.e. By eliminating not-used cross-domain entities. This method has been applied to a concrete application case in the healthcare domain, with the goal of generating an ontological model from the XML schemas implementing the HL7 Version 3 Clinical Document Architecture Release 2.","","978-1-4799-4171-1","10.1109/3PGCIC.2014.88","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7024622","Ontology generation;XML Schema;OWL;Ontologies;HL7 CDA","XML;Ontologies;OWL;Semantics;Resource description framework;Optimization;Medical services","","","1","20","IEEE","29 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the quest for quality and performance, plug- interoperability of medical devices is a quality label for electronic health records (EHRs) and eHealth systems that effectively collect, process, and analyze medical data. However implementing standards typically involves additional costs, and unless widely implemented, standards do not guarantee interoperability. The OpenECG network aims to bridge the gap between standards on paper and their implementations promoting the practice of interoperability in electrocardiography. This paper reports on recent developments in ECG interoperability that involve OpenECG, focusing on SCP- ECG conformance testing, the pending amendment to the SCP-ECG standard, and harmonization efforts between HL7v3 aECG and SCP-ECG. The expert network of OpenECG combined with its open-source tools and free services, support ECG manufacturers and integrators in realizing ECG interoperability standards and creating robust peer-reviewed eHealth systems.","2325-8853","978-1-4244-2532-7","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4511889","","Electrocardiography;Patient monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Data analysis;Performance analysis;Costs;Bridges;Testing;Standards development;Open source software","","2","","10","","7 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The management of domain information will then allow different participants to integrate their legacy information or application servers to a nation-wide network and use widely approved services to communicate their proprietary data and services with a large group of clients. In this context, traditional healthcare information systems require fundamental re-engineering to new network-centric environments in order to reduce the huge costs of healthcare while maintaining the expected quality of public health. This integration using new HL7 v3 standards and leading-edge information technologies will be the initial steps for shifting towards an interoperable healthcare environment. This paper aims at addressing new challenges in standard-based interoperability provision among legacy healthcare information systems, while adhering to international and national standards for data and service representations. We introduce a framework to employ healthcare standards and clinical terminology systems to achieve semantic interoperability between distributed electronic medical record (EMR) systems.

In this context, most research activities are focused towards standardization and interoperability among the legacy systems within the same domain. However, an emerging challenge is to address the communication of information among heterogeneous legacy systems in different domains. The first step in achieving such a large interoperability is to follow similar development processes for collaborating domains, which provides homogeneity in their architectures. The second step would be to provide cross-domain semantic interoperability through proprietary and shared ontology systems. In this paper, we address the above challenges through description of a framework that employs healthcare standards and clinical terminology systems to achieve semantic interoperability between distributed systems in different domains. The main focus in our proposed framework is the minimal use of domain knowledge for cross-domain interoperability. Two case studies are provided, first we present how HL7 v3 is over-specified and then the proposed framework is applied to achieve semantic interoperability between two domains healthcare and insurance.","","978-0-7695-3473-2","10.1109/APSCC.2008.132","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4780724","Cross-domain interoperability;Healthcare;HL7 v3;Minimized Domain Knowledge","Medical services;Insurance;Communication standards;Context;Terminology;Standards development;Banking;Web services;Application software;Standardization","","2","","19","IEEE","10 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The MedlmGrid ontologies share the same vocabulary to simplify the knowledge discovery and semantic transformation within distributed environment. The rule-based ontology mapping components are also designed to support semantic operations of MedlmGrid.
