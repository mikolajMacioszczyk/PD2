"A Preliminary Implementation of HL7 FHIR to Achieve Interoperability in Indonesia's Local EHR","I. F. Hidayat; B. R.

Interoperability is needed by the primary health centers in Indonesia to enable seamless transfer of patient's health records across healthcare facilities. However, the development of EHR in Indonesia makes interoperability difficult to achieve because it is built differently among healthcare services. This study aims to explore the feasibility of implementing the HL7 FHIR standard in the Indonesian primary health center's EHR. Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is a health interoperability standard developed by HL7 that supports syntactic interoperability upon the concept of resources and API. This interoperability standard helps to build the bridge to enable coordination between different systems. In this study, we implemented an EHR client-server prototype to simulate the exchange of health data using the FHIR resources and REST API. The health data messages were modeled and structured as a FHIR resource. The calculation of content overlap shows that only 65.8% of local health data can be represented as a FHIR resource. We did the profiling to further adapt the use of FHIR resources to meet Indonesia's health data requirements. The extensions were added to represent the local data elements that FHIR resources cannot cover. This preliminary study showed that FHIR implementation is possible in Indonesia's primary health centers. The implementation of 111.7 FHIR using FHIR resources, profile, and REST API supports the syntactic and semantic interoperability. It can provide quality data to support the referral system, analysis purposes, and health decision-making.","","978-1-7281-6587-5","10.1109/ICT49546.2020.9239534","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9239534","interoperability;FHIR;resources;profile;REST API","Semantics;Decision making;Medical services;Syntactics;Telecommunications;Interoperability;Standards","","5","","22","IEEE","30 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

FHIR is engaging and evolving rapidly and it is creating the need of massive data storage, retrieval and transfer requirements. For a server that implements this framework, has to be agile to cope with the growing and massive data handling. E-health-care data also seem to grow proportional to time. So, an ideal FHIR Server has to be scalable to fit this demand over time. Several different tools could help store, anonymize, analyze and extract data because there are no single tools to get all those things done. In this work, we propose a scalable, agile, and reliable Micro-service based Architecture for FHIR server that is highly available with the help of Document Oriented Database and helps to store health-care data. The proposed architecture is fast responsive. It gives our system the flexibility to use different tools that implement FHIR Framework interface in such way that the whole system could be made vertically scalable and the system can perform better in terms of time complexity compared to a Monolithic based implementation of the framework. Experimental results show that the proposed model can be highly used as an alternative to currently available FHIR system implementation.","","978-1-5386-1150-0","10.1109/ICCITECHN.2017.8281846","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8281846","FHIR;Interoperability;REST API;Health-Care system;scalability;micro-service","Servers;Logic gates;Business;Benchmark testing;Databases;Scalability;Tools","","6","","15","IEEE","8 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, electrocardiograms (ECGs) include transmission, management, and storage challenges due to their stream-like characteristic of the information. Researchers have proposed ECG streaming by ignoring or modifying the FHIR standards. This work proposes FASS-ECG, a FHIR-compatible cloud API for streaming ECGs. FASS-ECG contains endpoints for reading and writing long-term ECGs distributed in multiple web requests. Two FASS-ECG designs are investigated to process, store, and persist one ECG record despite the distributed transmission. FASS-ECG designs rely on object storage software and data partitioning in the database. The results show that both FASS-ECG designs can stream ECGs fully compatible with FHIR standard records.

HL7 is now experimenting with a new approach to the development of standards with FHIR. This research provides a chronicle of the evolution of the HL7 messaging standards, an introduction to HL7 FHIR and a comparative analysis between HL7 FHIR and previous HL7 messaging standards.","1063-7125","978-1-4799-1053-3","10.1109/CBMS.2013.6627810","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6627810","eHealth;Interoperability;Healthcare;Standards;FHIR;HL7 v3;Agile;RESTful;Informatics","Interoperability;Object oriented modeling;Software;Hospitals;Standards organizations","","307","","18","IEEE","10 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Ontologies are the key to achieve and improve healthcare interoperability, in the form of a permanent artefact of the specification of each of the medical concepts. However, since different ontologies may have contradicting or overlapping parts, the need for the creation of ontology matching techniques for identifying similarities between them is rising. In the meantime, a large number of ontologies, vocabularies and taxonomies, as well as medical standards are constructed and globally adopted (e.g. HL7 FHIR), without promising the existence of a single global ontology, any time soon. Thus, a substantial overhaul of methodology is required to address the real complexity of health. This can be achieved through the FHIR Ontology Mapper (FOM) technique that is presented in this paper, which aims at constructing healthcare ontologies from any data source, and then identifying both the structural and semantic similarities between the latter and the HL7 FHIR resources ontologies. The final matchings derive from the mean of the latter, aiming at translating healthcare data of any type, into the widely adopted HL7 FHIR standard, thus enabling interoperability and improving the quality of patient care and research.","","978-1-5386-4294-8","10.1109/HealthCom.2018.8531149","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8531149","Healthcare interoperability;ontologies;ontology alignment;HL7 FHIR;syntactic similarity;semantic similarity","Ontologies;Medical services;Interoperability;Standards;Semantics;Organizations;Conferences","","11","","32","IEEE","11 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The emerging HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) framework appeals to developers and clinicians alike and is a promising candidate to modernise this domain. Novel IEEE 11073 standard proposals that specify a service-oriented architecture of networked medical devices are one example for an ICE architecture. They are based on expressing a device's capabilities and state in a machine-readable way in order to be safely accessed and manipulated by other participants in the networked device system. In this work, the domain information and service model of this ICE architecture was mapped to FHIR resources that were constrained and extended to support the modelling of this device architecture. Through the definition of a FHIR profile, the data structures were aligned, effectively allowing for the transformation of medical device observation data from ICE to FHIR representation without the need for any proprietary interface. The implementation of this transformation, e. g. as a gateway, bridges the structural interoperability gap between two contemporary communication architectures for medical devices and clinical information systems and thus lays the foundation for semantic interoperability that can be achieved through the combined use with controlled vocabularies. The consequent availability of device data enables secondary usage such as large-scale data analytics. Future sub-profiles for specific device types further simplify the transformation.","","978-1-5090-3862-6","10.1109/CSCN.2016.7785165","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7785165","","Standards;Interoperability;Measurement;Ice;Service-oriented architecture;Data models;Biomedical imaging","","6","","8","IEEE","19 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The IEEE 11073.x standards provide semantic interoperability; the Rosetta Mapping provides vendor-specific semantic interoperability; the IHE DEC/ACM/PIV /SDPi standards provide device-device and device-system communication of clinical care, alerts, and device control messaging, and FHIR provides the formal, granular, Restful JSON or XML message framework for reliable, flexible communication. Since 2005, IHE has been developing the open-source device toolset for home and hospital use. More recently, the IHE SDPi standards have enabled device control capabilities, a capability accelerated during the COVID-19 Coronavirus pandemic to allow nurses/physicians to operate ventilators and infusion devices outside the contaminated patient room. The SDPi innovations are âjust in time,â perhaps, because to support emerging âHospital in Homeâ or âICU in Homeâ programs, also accelerated by the desire to keep patients safely outside hospital full of COVID patients.

The recent, increasing adoption of a common standard, i.e., the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), makes it easier to exchange medical data among the several parties involved, for example, in an epidemiological research activity. However, this exchange process is hindered by regulatory frameworks due to privacy issues related to the presence of personal information, which allows patients to be identified directly (or indirectly) from their medical data. When properly used, de-identification techniques can provide crucial support in overcoming these problems. FHIR-DIET aims to bring flexibility and concreteness to the implementation of de-identification of health data, supporting many customised data-processing behaviours that can be easily configured and tailored to match specific use case requirements. Our solution enables faster and easier cooperation between legal and IT professionals to establish and implement de-identification rules.

Most of these standards are using XML-based/JSON-based or binary formats. The interoperability and compatibility between the various ECG formats are valid problems since many years. ECG monitoring is a challenging process due to many factors such as time limitation, data size, or device dependent parameters such as the number of used parallel sampling channels. Nowadays' portable and wearable devices with non-invasive single-lead ECG capability are able to provide continuous long-term ECG data streaming that can last for many hours or even for weeks of monitoring.

An XML implementation of the MMD was used to model the FHIR Schemas as Domain Models (DMs) against a generic Reference Model (RM) to provide syntactic validation. RDF triples were included in the domain models to provide missing semantics. The XML data instances were validated against their Domain Models. The DMs do not create any new types, they only express constraints of the RM types, this provides consistent query and data analysis capability across all DMs. RDF triples were extracted from the DMs and added to a triple store graph with the RM ontology. The XML data is also expressed as Literals in the graph. This study shows the feasibility of using MMD solutions to provide full operational semantic interoperability for the FHIR ecosystem.","","978-1-4673-9548-9","10.1109/ICHI.2015.74","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7349736","Health information systems;Information exchange;Health Level 7","Semantics;Medical services;Resource description framework;XML;Interoperability;Data models;Charge coupled devices","","11","","12","IEEE","10 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Posterior spinal fusion surgery is required to correct the deformity in patients with severe scoliosis. Surgeons frequently use radiographic measurements and patient reported outcomes to aid in surgical treatment and monitor patient rehabilitation. Shriners Hospitals for Children is a large healthcare system caring for a significant percentage of pediatric patients with scoliosis. Surgeons from SHC-Greenville and SHC-Lexington have recorded data from more than 1,000 individual scoliosis patients. However, these collected data are usually dispersed across individual healthcare sites, necessitating the development of an integrated clinical data repository for data sharing and management. In this paper, we established a standardized research data repository with FHIR resources to harmonize multi-modal patient data from multiple clinical sites. Additionally, a FHIR-compliant application with a web-based user interface was prototyped to enable clinicians and researchers to access scoliosis patient data within our integrated and standardized research repository. Patient cohort definitions can be used to search these records using the same FHIR application. This standardized data-sharing framework and healthcare information system can be applied to multi-site and multimodality studies for clinical and research purposes, with the ultimate goal of improving the quality of patient care.","","978-1-6654-0126-5","10.1109/BIBM52615.2021.9669649","Shriners Hospitals for Children; Microsoft; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9669649","FHIR;Data Harmonization;ETL;Application Development;Scoliosis Patient Care","Decision support systems;Pediatrics;Hospitals;Surgery;Imaging;Patient rehabilitation;Planning","","9","","4","IEEE","14 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Especially, prescription opioids contributed significantly to drug overdose deaths. To improve the surveillance of prescription opioid overdose, it is critical to accurately collect prescription opioid information and calculate morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs). However, plenty of detailed information is only contained in the free text Sig component of electronic health record (EHR) prescriptions and need to be extracted first. Moreover, it is also indispensable to normalize opioid information extracted from multiple heath care facilities to clinical data standards such as Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) for efficient clinical decision support. However, few efforts are spent in this direction at present. Methods: In this study, we designed and implemented a system that can automatically extract opioid information from free text in Sig and map them to FHIR. The system, named as Opioid2FHIR, applied multiple natural language processing (NLP) techniques for opioid information extraction and normalization. In order to reduce manual efforts, a general-purpose medication IE model was first leveraged. Based on 1, 000 opioid prescription records randomly selected from MIMICIII, post-processing rules were designed to adapt the IE model to opioid medications. Concept normalization models were also built to transform and map the extracted medication elements to fine-granular standard concepts in FHIR. The system was evaluated on another 1, 000 opioid prescription records in MIMICIII. Results: Opioid2FHIR obtained an F-measure of 0.963 for medication information extraction and an accuracy of 0.987 for medical concept normalization. Conclusions: A clinical NLP application to EHR opioid scripts would fill a current gap in available batch script processing tools and would greatly enhance individual prescription processing limitations of prescription drug monitoring programs and clinical MME calculators.","","978-1-7281-6215-7","10.1109/BIBM49941.2020.9313258","National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9313258","Opioid prescription;medication information extraction;Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR);natural language processing (NLP)","Drugs;Data mining;Natural language processing;MIMICs;Unified modeling language;Task analysis;Standards","","5","","15","IEEE","13 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this respect this study aims at proposing an advanced Home Gateway architecture that offers a unique data collection module, supporting direct data acquisition over multiple protocols (i.e. BLE, MQTT) and indirect data retrieval from cloud health services (i.e, GoogleFit). Moreover the solution propose a mechanism to automatically convert the original data format, carried over BLE, in HL7 FHIR by exploiting device capabilities semantic annotation implemented by means of FHIR resource as well. The adoption of such annotation enables the dynamic plug of new sensors within the instrumented environment without the need to stop and adapt the gateway. This simplifies the dynamic devices landscape customization requested by the several telemedicine applications contexts (e.g. CVD, Diabetes) and demonstrate, for the first time, a concrete example of using the FHIR standard not only (as usual) for health resources representation and storage but also as instrument to enable seamless integration of IoT devices.

In this paper, we design and implement an integration architecture of ISO 11073 DIM with FHIR resources using CoAP to exchange health information between personal health devices and healthcare providers for solving communication consumption issues and standardization issues. We design and implement an ISO/IEEE 11073 translator gateway for device standardization and an ISO/IEEE 11073/FHIR translator gateway for Electronic Health Record (EHR) standardization. In addition, we use CoAP as data transfer protocol. An android application that is developed acts as a health manager for healthcare consumers.

This information is recorded on paper or on electronically-stored in a digital format. A few years ago, both Brazilian government and private healthcare providers invested in Information and Communication Technology to replace paper medical record with Electronic Medical Record (EMR). Nowadays, EMRs are evolving into Electronic Health Record (EHR), which allows for interoperability between different systems. While brazilian public health system recommends the OpenEHR standard as an information model for EHR, private providers in Brazil have adopted the HL7 FHIR standard. This article proposes the GIRLS, a low-cost gateway for EHR interoperability that uses both standards.

An important task in health information exchange is to prove data integrity and strengthen the right to self-determination of individuals. This can be addressed using blockchain technology and dynamic consents. We aimed to develop a blockchain-based mobile platform called HealthPocket to exchange reliable health information with proven integrity through a dynamic consent system based on the HL7 FHIR standards. Through HealthPocket, subjects can selectively provide their consent to share specific medical and PGHD through proper authorization, and each response is converted into the JSON format with FHIR compatibility. We conducted a usability test to demonstrate health information exchange between primary and tertiary medical institutions. A total of 116 subjects used the HealthPocket mobile application to selectively share health information for at least one month, and conducted a questionnaire about their experience. In addition, medical staff of the institution could access the medical information shared by the participants and use it for treatment. The user surveys for patients examined the perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and overall service satisfaction. The mean overall satisfaction with the health information exchange service was the highest (4.67 out of 5 points). As security, personal information protection, and interoperability are main concerns related to health information exchange, blockchain technology can provide suitable solutions. For instance, when health information is exchanged using blockchain technology, it is impossible to alter data blocks.

We also note that many different types of sensors can be used for healthcare services. However, the works on the framework and protocol to manage the healthcare sensors in an integrated manner have not been done until now. In addition, the protocol used by the FHIR sensors does not support the RESTful architecture. These could lead to poor interoperability and compatibility for healthcare services. To address such problems, in this paper, we propose an integrated mobility management scheme for health care services in the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) based IoT networks.

The method uses fuzzy logic to infer data quality trust from a data user's trust preferences with respect to data producers, data production methods, verification of data items, and certification of data production methods. Implementation with an existing âSMART on FHIRâ app in primary care demonstrates the feasibility of model and method. An extension to FHIR resources for data quality trust allows for platform interoperability across system contexts. We consider dual process theories in designing a user interface that supports data quality trust for clinical decisions in heuristic and systematic cognitive processing modes.

In addition, Research on healthcare services that can collect bio signal data through wearable sensors using IoT technology and monitor and manage health based on the collected data is increasing significantly. In particular, in a situation where the world is entering a rapidly aging society, health care services are being researched and developed in the direction of preventing diseases in advance and maintaining a healthy life. Healthcare services are bringing important changes in the pandemic era caused by covid-19. There is a need for a system capable of efficiently sharing and exchanging information of heterogeneous services to prevent emergencies and support optimal medical services. In this paper, we designed and developed a system that can collect, convert, and store bio-signals from various wearable sensors into international standard data to develop such healthcare services. HL7 (health level seven) FHIR (fast healthcare interoperability resources) applied mutandis in this paper is a standard protocol for data exchange between medical information systems of real-time collected bio signals. In this paper, we implement an interface module that converts bio signals such as EEG (electroencephalography), ECG (electrocardiogram), EMG (electromyography), and PPG (photoplethysmography) collected in real time from a wearable sensor into a message structure defined by HL7 FHIR. The interface module consists of a client part and a server part. The client part generates a variety of signal data from the healthcare service user and delivers the message to the server part. The server part is designed and implemented to parse the received message by segment field unit and transmit whether the message is abnormal or not to the client part. The system designed and implemented in this paper will be utilized as a technology that can mutually share and exchange medical information in a customized healthcare service that reflects the needs of various customers and a telemedicine system.","","978-1-6654-1766-2","10.1109/PlatCon53246.2021.9680756","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9680756","healthcare services;HL7;FHIR;bio signals;real-time bio signals collection;electroencephalography (EEG);electrocardiogram (ECG);electromyography (EMG)","Protocols;Telemedicine;Medical services;Photoplethysmography;Real-time systems;Electromyography;Electroencephalography","","2","","17","IEEE","20 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Common standards can achieve interoperability, deciphering the meaning of the data exchanged. The general criterion that can be used is FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources). Data exchange with this standard is considered adequate and efficient when using the GraphQL approach because the client efficiently manages the requests he wants according to the data schema that has been defined. In addition, the Health Information System is said to be successful if electronic medical record data is always available if you want to use it. Therefore a storage system is needed to maintain the data's existence. The blockchain-based storage method with BigchainDB can solve this problem. These three technologies (FHIR, BigchainDB and GraphQL) are expected to produce a service-based system that can be used to exchange international standard electronic medical record data and can be applied across various systems. As a result, on one server node, the time required to read data is 0.32 ms, and the time needed to insert data is 47 ms. On three server nodes, the time necessary to read data is 0.175 ms and the time required to insert data is 1430 ms.

Therefore, in order to understand the health status of the elderly in detail, it is necessary to consider SDoH. However, integrating SDoH into a hospital EHR system has a problem that it is difficult to share SDoH between hospitals because the EHR system uses a different format for each hospital. Therefore, if the elderly are to be seen at another hospital, compatibility should be supported so that SDoH can be referred to. This study utilizes SDoH measurement tools such as smoking, drinking, physical activity, social function, etc. used by KFACS, an institution that identifies and analyzes the causes and effects of senility in elderly people.

Materials and Methods: Coordination in CAPABLE is achieved through the Case Manager, a component able to generate and notify events to other interested agent components. For representing and exchanging health care information we have adopted HL7 FHIR as a semantic interoperability standard. Results: FHIR has been exploited to design a structured history of a real patient affected by renal cell carcinoma. A simulator has been developed for automating the whole testing process represented by specific scenarios of the patientâs history.

Combining SS and blockchain is definitely a promising paradigm in the data security field. Recently, the fast healthcare interoperability resources (FHIRs) standard is defined for medical data exchange across various medical institutions. In this article, we combine SS, ElGamalâs encryption/decryption, and blockchain to propose a multihospital FHIR database authorization (MFDA). To achieve a secure MFDA, the group-based SS (GSS) and the notion using GSS on exponent (referred to as EGSS) are proposed. The secrets of GSS and EGSS have the discrete logarithm problem (DLP) relation, on which the secrets can be used as ElGamalâs private key and public key, respectively. Also, their shares will have DLP relation. By uploading public shares of EGSS on blockchain and using private shares of GSS in a private network, we can recover ElGamalâs public key from a deployed smart contract on blockchain and recover ElGamalâs private key from a qualified set. Meantime, when recovering private key, the private shares of GSS can be authenticated by public shares on blockchain to check tampering and corrupted of private shares during the communication in a private network. Theorems, examples, and experiments demonstrate that the proposed MFDA has efficient and secure database authorization.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2023.3328989","National Science and Technology Council(grant numbers:NSTC 112-2221-E-259-007-MY2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10308584","Blockchain;discrete logarithm problem (DLP);fast healthcare interoperability resources (FHIRs);Lagrange interpolation (LI);secret sharing (SS)","Blockchains;Additives;Databases;Hospitals;Cryptography;Interoperability;Authorization","","","","33","IEEE","3 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Bridging the clinical care findings at the bedside with the biomedical knowledge at the bench provide insights that can improve patient outcomes and lead to the development of new drugs and therapies. Research on translational medicine gained a great deal of prominence through the establishment of governmental and institutional boards like the US Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) and the EU Seventh Framework Program (FP7). TM research is ultimately requires data integration on a massive scale between variety of clinical data. In order to accelerate medical discovery, the integration of biomedical data needs to happen both at the physician point of care level via the electronic health records (EHRs) and at bench top applications and repositories. However, data integration is a great challenge to healthcare as the legacy technologies used are built around the REST APIs to get data into these biomedical applications and systems. The REST protocol is aging as it has been the technology used for the last 20 years. Major information technology venders like Facebook and Google have replaced REST with GraphQL allowing changes on the client side to fetch new data from the server without the need for extra work on the server. In this paper we are describing our efforts to integrate the problem oriented medical record (called QL4POMR that is based on GraphQL) which has been defined around the notion of SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Planning) to describe patient cases with the HL7 FHIR electronic record and the HL7 IPS patient summary as well as with other external biomedical repositories like the OpenTargets and the Drug Bank. The integration has been described via adding a data layer on top of the QL4POMR to enable the schema integration and querying from all these external sources via the GraphQL server. Our initial experimentations show success in discovering drug adverse events and in recommending alternative drugs at the time of prescribing new medication to patients and completing the planning section of SOAP.

However, there are many standards for defining such data, hindering communication between different healthcare providers. Even with adopted standards, patients often need to repeatedly provide their health information when they are taken care of at different locations. This problem hinders the adoption of personal health record (PHR), with the patients' health records under their own control. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to propose an interoperability model for PHR use. The methodology consisted prototyping an application model named OmniPHR, to evaluate the structuring of semantic interoperability and integration of different health standards, using a real database from anonymized patients. We evaluated health data from a hospital database with 38 645 adult patients' medical records processed using different standards, represented by openEHR, HL7 FHIR, and MIMIC-III reference models. OmniPHR demonstrated the feasibility to provide interoperability through a standard ontology and artificial intelligence with natural language processing (NLP). Although the first executions reached a 76.39% F1-score and required retraining of the machine-learning process, the final score was 87.9%, presenting a way to obtain the original data from different standards on a single format. Unlike other models, OmniPHR presents a unified, structural semantic and up-to-date vision of PHR for patients and healthcare providers. The results were promising and demonstrated the possibility of subsidizing the creation of inferences rules about possible patient health problems or preventing future problems.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2018.2836138","Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development(grant numbers:405354/2016-9,303640/2017-0); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8358689","Personal Health Record;Semantic Interoperability;Ontology;Natural Language Processing","Standards;Interoperability;Semantics;Medical services;Data models;Ontologies;Natural language processing","Adult;Biological Ontologies;Computer Simulation;Electronic Health Records;Health Information Interoperability;Health Records, Personal;Humans;Natural Language Processing;Semantics","46","","36","IEEE","14 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Modern wearable health monitoring devices have become easily available in the consumer market, however, real-time analyses and prediction along with alerts and alarms about a health hazard are not adequately addressed in such devices. Taking ECG monitoring as a case study the research paper focusses on signal processing, arrhythmia detection and classification and at the same time focusses on updating the electronic health records database in realtime such that the concerned medical practitioners become aware of an emergent situation the patient being monitored might face. Also, heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is usually considered as a basis for arrhythmia classification which largely depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the biopotential measurements of the ECG kits, so it may not yield accurate results. Initially, the ECG readings from the 3-Lead ECG analog front-end were de-noised, zero-offset corrected, filtered using recursive least square adaptive filter and smoothed using Savitzky-Golay filter and subsequently passed to the data analysis component with a unique feature extraction method to increase the accuracy of classification. The machine learning models trained on MITDB arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH Physionet) showed more than 97% accuracy using kNN classifiers. Neuralnet fitting models showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. ECG abnormalities based on annotations in MITDB could be classified and these ECG observations could be logged to a server implementation based on FHIR standards. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and ECG event observations were coded according to SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions. The system emphasizes on `preventive care rather than remedial cure' as the next generation personalized health-care monitoring devices become available.","","978-1-5090-4815-1","10.1109/ITECHA.2017.8101902","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8101902","Arrhythmia classification;Wearable IoT;Healthcare monitoring;ECG signal processing;Arrhythmia detection;Arrhythmia Neural-Net;MITDB Physionet;GP Connect;HL7;ECG FHIR;SNOMED-CT FHIR;HAPI FHIR","Electrocardiography;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Databases;Adaptive filters;Real-time systems","","26","","34","IEEE","9 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"ECG classification and prognostic approach towards personalized healthcare","A. Walinjkar; J. Woods","Department of Computer Science and Electronics Engineering, University of Essex, Colchester, Essex; Department of Computer Science and Electronics Engineering, University of Essex, Colchester, Essex","2017 International Conference On Social Media, Wearable And Web Analytics (Social Media)","9 Oct 2017","2017","","","1","8","A very important aspect of personalized healthcare is to continuously monitor an individual's health using wearable biomedical devices and essentially to analyse and if possible to predict potential health hazards that may prove fatal if not treated in time. The prediction aspect embedded in the system helps in avoiding delays in providing timely medical treatment, even before an individual reaches a critical condition. Despite of the availability of modern wearable health monitoring devices, the real-time analyses and prediction component seems to be missing with these devices. The research work illustrated in this paper, at an outset, focussed on constantly monitoring an individual's ECG readings using a wearable 3-lead ECG kit and more importantly focussed on performing real-time analyses to detect arrhythmia to be able to identify and predict heart risk. Also, current research shows extensive use of heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and machine learning for arrhythmia classification, which however depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the ECG equipment. Since a wearable 3-lead ECG kit was used, the accuracy of classification had to be dealt with at the machine learning phase, so a unique feature extraction method was developed to increase the accuracy of classification. As a case study a very widely used Arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH, Physionet) was used to develop learning, classification and prediction models. Neuralnet fitting models on the extracted features showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. Current experiments show 99.4% accuracy using k-NN Classification models and show values of Cross-Entropy Error of 7.6 and misclassification error value of 1.2 on test data using scaled conjugate gradient pattern matching algorithms. Software components were developed for wearable devices that took ECG readings from a 3-Lead ECG data acquisition kit in real time, de-noised, filtered and relayed the sample readings to the tele health analytical server. The analytical server performed the classification and prediction tasks based on the trained classification models and could raise appropriate alarms if ECG abnormalities of V (Premature Ventricular Contraction: PVC), A (Atrial Premature Beat: APB), L (Left bundle branch block beat), R (Right bundle branch block beat) type annotations in MITDB were detected. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and abnormal ECG events related to arrhythmia, from analytical server could be logged using an FHIR web service implementation, according to a SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions. The system focused on `preventive care rather than remedial cure' which has become a major focus of all the health care and cure institutions across the globe.","","978-1-5090-5057-4","10.1109/SOCIALMEDIA.2017.8057360","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8057360","ECG classification;Wearable IoT;preventive health-care;real-time ECG;arrhythmia detection;arrhythmia Neural-Net;MITDB;Physionet;GP Connect;HL7;FHIR","Electrocardiography;Heart;Real-time systems;Databases;Biomedical monitoring;Monitoring;Feature extraction","","16","","53","IEEE","9 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, in the context of the recent soaring of security breaches and surveillance in incidents reported, a solution to ensure the safety and privacy of data is essential.

Traditionally, these Device Interoperability Middleware (DIM) are analyzed using software testing. However, given the inherent incompleteness of testing and the randomness of the user behaviours, the analysis results are not guaranteed to be accurate. Some of these inaccuracies in analysis results could even put human life at risk. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose to use a probabilistic model checker PRISM for analyzing DIM. The proposed approach allows us to rigorously verify reliability properties of the given DIM and thus allows the designers to make appropriate measures to design more reliable systems.

Unfortunately, determining the causes of death is challenging even for experienced physicians. The novel coronavirus and its variants may further complicate the task, as physicians and experts are still investigating COVID-related complications. To assist physicians in accurately reporting causes of death, an advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach is presented to determine a chronically ordered sequence of conditions that lead to death (named as the causal sequence of death), based on decedent's last hospital discharge record. The key design is to learn the causal relationship among clinical codes and to identify death-related conditions. There exist three challenges: different clinical coding systems, medical domain knowledge constraint, and data interoperability. First, we apply neural machine translation models with various attention mechanisms to generate sequences of causes of death. We use the BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy) score with three accuracy metrics to evaluate the quality of generated sequences. Second, we incorporate expert-verified medical domain knowledge as constraints when generating the causal sequences of death. Lastly, we develop a Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) interface that demonstrates the usability of this work in clinical practice.

To address this issue, we propose a unified system for the collection of raw sensor data from smart devices (i.e., smartphones and smartwatches) of various manufacturers as well as health survey data. The data collection application part of our system is available on Android, Wear OS and iOS, and stores data on a oneM2M-based Internet of Things platform via representational state transfer application programmable interfaces. Using the system, we collected data from 300 participants over the course of 60 days. After collecting the data, we analyzed the data set and then proposed a method to archive health-related lifelog in a standardized manner following the fast healthcare interoperability resources (FHIRs) protocol.

Action plans that consolidate existing digital transformation programs are being reviewed to establish core infrastructure and foundations for sustainable healthcare solutions. Reforming health and social care to personalize home care, for example, can help avoid treatment in overcrowded acute hospital settings and improve the experiences and outcomes for both healthcare professionals and service users. In this information-intensive domain, addressing the interoperability challenge through standards-based roadmaps is crucial for enabling effective connections between health and social care services. This approach facilitates safe and trustworthy data workflows between different healthcare system providers.In this paper, we present a methodology for extracting, transforming, and loading data through a semi-automated process using a Common Semantic Standardized Data Model (CSSDM) to create personalized healthcare knowledge graph (KG). The CSSDM is grounded in the formal ontology of ISO 13940 ContSys and incorporates FHIR-based specifications to support structural attributes for generating KGs. We propose that the CSSDM facilitates data harmonization and linking, offering an alternative approach to interoperability.

Our proposed framework provides support to public health data systems to integrate data from a heterogeneous EHR and other sources, and consolidate them for public health analysis or mining. Models are created for both hospital EHR and FHIR formats and automated transformations are created to convert EHR to Public Health Record (PHR). This framework provides staff in public health departments a consolidated picture of a population's health based on individual EHR and contextual information such as social, economic, environmental and epidemiology elements. Unlike existing frameworks, this research proposes an infrastructure that sends complete longitudinal story of health record of public health interest instead of aggregated information. The framework also obviates the need for a single EHR format to be followed at every participating healthcare facility. This is done through an adapter at each site. This framework provides a comprehensive means of support for public health agencies to identify the determinants of health based on ground truth when considering priority populations and using EHR data and contextual information to focus public health action.","2472-8586","978-1-5386-0501-1","10.1109/ICAICT.2017.8687289","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8687289","Public health analysis;Health Information Exchange (HIE);Electronic Health Records (EHR);Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)","","","6","","18","IEEE","11 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
