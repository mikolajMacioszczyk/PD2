It defines the standard service models and APIs, and offers a whole lifetime data storage method to the patient's record. As an important OpenEHR system component, EHRServer plays the role of back-end services repository for data storage and query. It complies with the openEHR specifications and adopts MySQL database. However, current EHRServer has many limitations. For example, its official requirement stresses that one organization cannot access the EHR owned by other organizations. The original EHRServer database is in plaintext format. It can lead to the risk of electronic record leakage. Encryption is one common protection method, but the current EHRServer APIs do not support encrypted data query. That restricts building EHRServer on the cloud. What's more, the inconvenience of information sharing among different organizations may also hinder the extension of OpenEHR coverage to more domains and countries. To solve the above open problems, in this paper, we explore two approaches which guarantee the security and flexibility of sharing EHR on the cloud and thus propose a new architecture called Crypt-EHRServer. Firstly, we use attribute-based encryption to realize flexible EHR access authority for different authorized organizations. Secondly, we learn from an efficient ciphertext query model, CryptDB, and adopt their onion encryption approach to support standard SQL queries on the encrypted EHR. The result of our work could provide a flexible, scalable and secure EHR system. Crypt-EHRServer will benefit OpenEHR's widespread adoption in the world, and will also arouse people's awareness about incorporating security criteria into the design of electronic health records management systems.","2375-527X","978-1-5386-0840-1","10.1109/ISPAN-FCST-ISCC.2017.56","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8121778","Attribute Based Encryption;Open EHR;Searchable Encryption;CryptDB","Encryption;Servers;Standards;Databases;Keyword search","","2","","30","IEEE","30 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, a collaborative modeling group was established consisting of two clinical experts, two informatics experts and two modeling engineers. Then, the official document for Stroke screening issued by China National Health Commission and NINDS Stroke CRF were adopted as the data requirement sources to refine the domain concepts. Based on the domain concepts refined, the Healthcare Modeling Collaboration (HMC) platform was used to develop openEHR archetypes with constraint from NINDS Stroke CDEs. Finally, an openEHR archetype set consisting of 39 archetypes was established, among which 43.6% (17) were directly reused from Clinical Knowledge Manager (CKM), 25.6% (10) were extended and 30.8% (12) were newly created. All of these archetypes attributes were constrained by mapping 358 NINDS Stroke CDEs.

In this context, the openEHR specification facilitates the management of health data in electronic health records (EHRs), while the ISO/IEEE11073 (also referred to as X73PHD) family of standards provides a reference framework for medical device interoperability. Hospitals and health care providers using openEHR require flawless integration of data coming from external sources, such as X73PHD. Hence, a harmonization process is crucial for achieving a seamless, coherent use of those specifications in real scenarios. Such harmonization is the aim of this paper. Thus, the classes and attributes of a representative number of X73PHD specializations for medical devices—weight, temperature, blood pressure, pulse and heart rate, oximetry, and electrocardiograph—along with the X73PHD core document—ISO/IEEE11073–20601—have been analyzed and mapped to openEHR archetypes. The proposed methodology reuses the existing archetypes when possible and suggests new ones—or appropriate modifications—otherwise. As a result, this paper analyzes the inconsistencies found and the implications thereof in the coordinated use of these two standards. The procedure has also shown how existing standards are able to influence the archetype development process, enhancing the existing archetype corpus.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2013.2285441","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6627974","Archetypes;harmonization;ISO/IEEE 11073;openEHR;standards","Biomedical monitoring;ISO standards;Blood pressure;Monitoring;Protocols;ISO","Computer Communication Networks;Electrocardiography;Electronic Health Records;Humans;Medical Informatics Computing;Monitoring, Physiologic;Oximetry;Systems Integration","4","","31","IEEE","10 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In 2014, it was estimated that 41 million children in all world, under the age of 5 were overweight or obese. Despite all the efforts, the number of overweight and obese children/adolescents is rising in almost all countries. Meanwhile, some points impaired the healthcare professionals to follow obesity guideline clinical practice (CPG). Information systems have an important role to play in the maintaining of this reality. Aim: To propose a set of archetypes for the integration of CPG recommendations for treatment and prevention of obesity in children and adolescents in an openEHR based Electronic Health Record (EHR). Methods: We assessed obesity guidelines as National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), American Academic of Paediatrics (AAP), Brazilian Association for the Study of Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome (ABESO), World Health Organization (WHO) and Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) and selected the most representative variables in nutrition parameters (anthropometry, body composition, nutrients intake, etc.) in order to create/ find archetypes in Clinical Knowledge Manager (CKM) repository, and, finally, compose a template in openEHR. Results: 38 variables were identified in guidelines. However, only 22 archetypes were necessary to represent all of them. Of these 22 archetypes, 8 are already available in CKM, while 14 clinical statements had no archetype representation and they had to be created. Conclusion: Based on the created archetypes, an openEHR template can be created for the representation of clinical statements regarding the most important clinical guidelines in obesity. This template can be used by nutritionists and others health professionals to manage data relevant to obesity care.","2372-9198","978-1-5386-1710-6","10.1109/CBMS.2017.96","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8104194","component;Electronic health records;Nutrition;Clinical practice guideline;openEHR;Obesity.","Obesity;Pediatrics;Guidelines;Blood;Organizations;Information systems","","3","","35","IEEE","13 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Physicians can only monitor and prescribe patients in time, if the data is shared with their HMIS. HMIS can be compliant to different healthcare standards. Therefore, mediation system is required to enable interoperability between HHMS and HMIS such that physicians and patients information can easily be exchanged.

We consider that HMIS are compliant to two heterogeneous EHR standards (HL7 CDA and openEHR). Alzheimer's patient case study is described as a proof of concept. Sensory information gathered at HHMS, is communicated with HMIS compliant to EHR based healthcare standards. Sensors information in XML form is converted by interoperability service to HL7 CDA and openEHR instances and communicated to HMIS afterwards.

The potential for workflow support to coordinate services and improve communication in the context of chronic disease management is intuitively appealing, but is still a challenging (and hence rarely seen) accomplishment in practice. We examine the problem of achieving a close relationship of electronic health record (EHR) content to other components of a clinical information system (guidelines, decision support and workflow), with particular emphasis on integrating the EHR with workflow. We use the openEHR architecture, which allows extension of a core reference model via archetypes, to refine the detailed information recording options for specific points in the workflow and to represent the chain of instructions that is the workflow itself. We illustrate the use of openEHR for tracking the relationship of a series of clinical services or events to a guideline-based workflow via a case study of an early supported discharge (ESD) program for post-stroke rehabilitation. This case study shows the contribution guideline content and its derived workflow can have on problem specific EHR structure and demonstrates the potential for a constructive interaction of workflow support and the EHR. We conclude with a discussion of the practical boundary of applicability of workflow approaches versus decision support system approaches in supporting guideline-based care.","","0-7695-2056-1","10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265353","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265353","","Guidelines;Diseases;Decision support systems;Medical services;Clinical diagnosis;Distributed computing;Context-aware services;Context;Electrostatic discharge;Aging","","5","","23","IEEE","26 Feb 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In OpenEHR, all of a patient's health data to be stored in the history of life, are independent vendors, and centered on one person. HL7 (Health Level Seven) is one of many ANSI standard which has been accredited by SDO (Standards Developing Organizations). HL7 does not develop healthcare or hospital software application, but it only develops the concepts, methodology, specification, and standard, so exchanging data among different application is possible to be done. Conceptually, this exchanging data method is known as Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). As an embodiment to provide standardization of HIS based on Health Level Seven, it is achieved by building a web service of HIS based on HL7. This web service will be expected to make a standardizing the health data based on HL7, so that the process of data exchange or health information becomes more structured.","","978-1-5386-2985-7","10.1109/IAC.2017.8280571","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8280571","web service;HL7;openEHR;electronic data interchange","Web services;Medical services;Standards organizations;Organizations;Information systems;XML","","4","","11","IEEE","5 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To avoid considering healthcare workflows in isolation, we investigate the usage of our CSP dialect for formally modeling workflows alongside the instruction model of the openEHR specification set, which is a general, maintainable, and interoperable approach to electronic health records. Hence, we present a CSP model for openEHR instructions, which allows timed reasoning, and also integrates a basic notion of data and undefinedness. We show that this CSP dialect is suited to verify important properties of healthcare workflows, like workflow consistency, checking against timed specifications, and resource scheduling.","","978-1-4673-1843-3","10.1109/SEHC.2012.6227002","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6227002","Healthcare Workflows;Formal Methods;Verification;CSP;OpenEHR","Medical services;Synchronization;Standards;Semantics;Real time systems;Data models","","4","","21","IEEE","28 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The aim of this review was to find out to what extent CDS developers have actually considered EHR integration in developing CDS. We have also investigated how various clinical standards are taken into account by CDS developers. We observed that there are few CDS development projects where EHR integration is taken into account. Also, the number of studies where various clinical standards are taken into consideration in developing CDS is surprisingly low especially for openEHR, the EHR standard we aimed for. The reasons for low adoption of openEHR are issues such as complex and huge specifications, shortcomings in educational aspects, low empirical focus and low support for developers. It is concluded that there is a need for further investigation to discover the reasons why the rate of integration of EHRs and CDS is not at an optimum level and mostly to discover why CDS developers are not keen to adopt clinical standards.","","978-83-60810-39-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6078191","","Standards;Guidelines;Terminology;Medical services;Communities;Educational institutions;Cognition","","2","","65","","14 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, the exponential growth of EHRs should be managed by eliminating the need of storing sparse values. Traditional approaches favor the adoption of the relational approach as a data model for storing data due to its simplicity, SQL query support, and availability of mature data analysis tools. However, the relational model falls short when a generic schema and eradicating sparseness are utterly required. To accommodate the requirements of generic schema and elimination of sparseness in EHRs, alternative models such as Entity Attribute Value (EAV), Dynamic Tables (DT), Optimized Entity Attribute Value (OEAV), and Optimized Column-oriented Model (OCOM) have been proposed at the logical level. These models utilize the vertical representation of data as opposed to the horizontal representation used by the relational model. Authors in current research considered 50K instances (as per relational data model) of standardized EHRs to critically analyze the impact of changing logical (i.e., EAV, DT, OEAV, and OCOM) and physical (i.e., row-oriented and column-oriented) structure of data on space acquired by dataset and time required for query execution. Further, authors favored the use of standardized EHRs to achieve semantic interoperability and thus, adopt the openEHR standard for experimentation purpose. It has been observed that the column-oriented storage approach is more space-efficient than the row-oriented storage approach. Also, the OCOM data model is the most space-efficient among all the data models followed by DT (using a column-oriented storage approach). On the contrary, DT, when stored in column-oriented databases, is found to be the most time-efficient among analyzed data models.","","978-1-7281-6215-7","10.1109/BIBM49941.2020.9313343","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9313343","Entity Attribute Value Model;Optimized Entity Attribute Value Model;Optimized Column-oriented Model;Dynamic Tables;Sparse Data;Healthcare;openEHR","Data models;Interoperability;Semantics;Object oriented modeling;Medical services;History;Analytical models","","5","","12","IEEE","13 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, firstly we have studied the current trends in Indian Health Care with respect to medical data storage and retrieval. Next, we have compared the performance of MySQL (relational) and Db4o (object) database in terms of persistence time and storage space for a sample hospital data of 100 users.","","978-1-4799-5173-4","10.1109/IC3.2014.6897167","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6897167","EHR;openEHR;Database;Db4o;MySQL","Medical services;Standards;Relational databases;Object oriented modeling;Memory;Electronic medical records","","5","","26","IEEE","15 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We have chosen childhood as an object of study because of childhood is very important in the human's life, and child health care is one of the key medical services. We refer to HL7 standards and openEHR specification, to use UML modeling techniques for system design. The main functional modules of the system include Health information on women's health during pregnancy, Infant and child medical information management, Infant and child health information management. The SD card contains the personal health application and a small database of personal health information.

However, there are many standards for defining such data, hindering communication between different healthcare providers. Even with adopted standards, patients often need to repeatedly provide their health information when they are taken care of at different locations. This problem hinders the adoption of personal health record (PHR), with the patients' health records under their own control. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to propose an interoperability model for PHR use. The methodology consisted prototyping an application model named OmniPHR, to evaluate the structuring of semantic interoperability and integration of different health standards, using a real database from anonymized patients. We evaluated health data from a hospital database with 38 645 adult patients' medical records processed using different standards, represented by openEHR, HL7 FHIR, and MIMIC-III reference models. OmniPHR demonstrated the feasibility to provide interoperability through a standard ontology and artificial intelligence with natural language processing (NLP). Although the first executions reached a 76.39% F1-score and required retraining of the machine-learning process, the final score was 87.9%, presenting a way to obtain the original data from different standards on a single format. Unlike other models, OmniPHR presents a unified, structural semantic and up-to-date vision of PHR for patients and healthcare providers.

However, standards are highly complex and require a large amount of interpretation, deployments are currently scarce, and performance evaluations simplistic or speculative. In this paper, we focus on the experimental evaluation of latency in IoT service composition with mobile gateways (GWs). We measure latency between system components and quantify application protocol overheads to assess the capabilities and limitations of a standard M2M middleware. We designed and implemented a mobile e-health use case on top of ETSI M2M and openEHR standards. We ran a pilot remote monitoring ten people for three weeks, collecting nearly 480 h of data. Our results show that while the latency added by a broker lies around 25 ms, the cellular network often exceeds 1 s, becoming a problem for interactive applications. Moreover, we observe that latencies between a smartphone GW and cloud hosted services vary largely depending on the user mobility, and on the promotion delay of the used wireless network.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2017.2689682","project NanoSTIMA(grant numbers:NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000016); builds upon software and datasets that resulted from I-City for Future Health(grant numbers:NORTE-07-0124-FEDER-000068); FP7 - Future Cities(grant numbers:FP7-REGPOT-2012-2013-1); direct funding by PT Inovação - Altice Labs.

Despite the potential benefits offered by EHR data, it is challenging to represent and analyze large EHRs for predictive modeling due to heterogeneity, high dimensionality, and sparsity. This article proposes a novel supervised Deep Similarity Learning approach that learns the patient representations and also finds the relationship between the patients using pairwise similarity learning to facilitate predictive analysis for personalized healthcare. We develop CNN_Softmax which is a Siamese-based neural network for multi-class classification methods corresponding to the prediction of disease. It uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to study the vector representation of raw EHRs and capture essential information of patient features, and a Softmax-based supervised classification method that learns the similarity between pairs of patients and performs disease prediction using this similarity information. Our approach uses data type mapping to handle heterogeneity and the polynomial interpolation method to handle sparsity existing in EHR data. ORBDA, which is an openEHR (standard) benchmark dataset, is used for evaluating this study. Experimental results show that CNN_Softmax achieves an accuracy of 97.8%, a recall of 98.1%, a precision of 96.02%, and an F1 score of 97.82%. The comparative results show that our proposed novel methodology performs disease prediction with highly promising results and outperforms state-of-the-art similarity learning methods. The current study is the first attempt to perform disease prediction on standardized EHRs, to the best of the authors' knowledge. The deep similarity learning approach provides support for clinical decision making that is more reliable and generalizable than previous approaches and focuses on dealing with heterogeneous and sparse data. The concept also serves as a new implementation of artificial intelligence technologies for the application of clinical big data.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3037710","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9257424","Convolutional neural networks;deep learning;electronic health records;nephrology;similarity learning;softmax-based technique","Deep learning;Diseases;Medical services;Predictive models;Data models;Medical diagnostic imaging;Feature extraction","","18","","65","CCBYNCND","12 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To advance towards those visions, it is imperative to gain the trust of the involved stakeholders, doctors and other medical personnel, patients, families, health care providers and regulators. Even though one critical requirement is interoperability among the various systems involved, currently existing solutions are still vertical silos to a large extent. In this paper, we present an E-health solution that results from the integration of components that comply with rising standards at the various levels of the ICT infrastructure: Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications for interconnecting devices and services, Health Level 7 (HL7) for communicating with health platforms and openEHR for data semantics, storing and making data available. Concretely, we provide an interoperable and extensible e-health service following these three uprising standards and present the architecture design. We map the service to the various components of the infrastructure building blocks, thus demonstrating how the integration can be successfully accomplished. We are currently developing a prototype solution to be used in a pilot project with 15 elders.","","978-1-4799-6644-8","10.1109/HealthCom.2014.7001821","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001821","Machine-to-machine communications;EHR;HL7;openEHR;system integration","Standards;Mobile handsets;Medical services;Monitoring;Logic gates;Subscriptions;Interoperability","","9","","19","IEEE","8 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite the growing popularity of FHIR, the available evidence provides a compelling reason to believe that its use is still accompanied by a significant number of technical challenges. Therefore, the development of tools to ensure its convenient visualization remains a pressing need for a variety of stakeholders operating in the healthcare industry. Results of the systematic literature review that included 26 studies provide valuable information about the most popular instruments in this area, such as the OpenEHR CKM approach. The review offers a critical discussion of the most important advantages and disadvantages of different approaches. It provides valuable recommendations for further research as well as practical recommendations concerning the best ways to utilize data visualization platforms based on FHIR. It defines the tradeoff of functionality versus the ease of dissemination as one of the most important problems facing most platforms and suggests avenues for developing additional tooling support for visualizing FHIR. The results of the research could be useful both for scientists and practitioners.","","979-8-3503-1993-4","10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys57074.2022.00340","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10074714","FHIR;HL7 FHIR EHR;OpenEHR;CKM;SMART on FHIR","Industries;Systematics;Bibliographies;Instruments;Data visualization;Pressing;Medical services","","2","","40","IEEE","28 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Open-Source Software (OSS) projects often operate in a different manner compared to proprietary software projects. This study investigates contemporary SA documentation practices in OSS projects to gain insights into: (1) what architectural elements are described, (2) what the different description formats and types are, and (3) what the maturity of the architecture description is. The SA description documentation of six OSS projects is identified, classified, and evaluated: VLC, OpenEHR, openKM, GIMP, Audacity, and Home Assistant. The results show that natural language is widely used in describing the architecture, sometimes accompanied by diagrams of informal models. The majority of documentation was found on websites and wikis. The maturity was evaluated by applying the Architectural Capability Model (ArchCaMo). Out of the five maturity levels, most projects did not get past the first level. Only one project reached the second level, and one project showed potential for level three as it was the only project with explicitly documented SA design decisions.","","978-1-6654-1728-0","10.1109/ICSA53651.2022.00013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9779701","Architecture description maturity;Open-source software;Software architecture;Software documentation","Industries;Electronic publishing;Software architecture;Conferences;Natural languages;Information services;Documentation","","2","","50","IEEE","24 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such systems have been shown to improve care delivery and reduce costs. However, the lack of integration with Electronic Health Record systems and their high cost of maintenance have been identified as important barriers to their adoption. This paper aims, first, to describe a meta-architecture to seamlessly interoperate non-rule-based CDSS with archetype-based Electronic Health Records and, second, to allow the CDSS to perform self-maintenance tasks over its knowledge and inference engine. To achieve these objectives the Dual-Model Approach, in combination with clinical terminologies have been used to define a system capable to be plugged into any OpenEHR system and maintain its knowledge by using the semantics described through clinical terminologies.","2168-2208","978-1-4799-2131-7","10.1109/BHI.2014.6864416","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6864416","","Diseases;Engines;Terminology;Maintenance engineering;Interoperability;Electronic medical records;Knowledge based systems","","1","","30","IEEE","26 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As ontology research in the biomedical field becomes increasingly mature, it has become a mainstream technical means to satisfy the demand for representation and organization of medical knowledge in CDSS under the current big data environment by constructing medical knowledge ontology. However, in practical application scenarios, the ontology is too large in scale and granularity, and it can not be directly used to assist diagnosis and clinical decision-making. Therefore, this paper designs a universal ontology model based on semantic relationships to represent disease knowledge and develops a mapping system through this model to generate consistent and usable openEHR archetypes. The archetypes can be directly applied to the CDSS platform and build the required templates, effectively improving the construction speed of the CDSS knowledge base.","2771-6902","979-8-3503-3007-6","10.1109/BigDIA60676.2023.10429558","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10429558","CDSS;OWL;Ontology;OpenEHR;Model Transformation","Java;Semantics;Ontologies;Data models;Medical diagnostic imaging;Engines;Diseases","","1","","15","IEEE","15 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this process they are becoming highly distributed and specialized. Innovative approaches are needed to fully support the design and deployment of new eHealth interventions. Design should be based on theory and evidence, and deployment should be supported by a sustainable ICT platform, that enables interoperability and reusability by focusing on open standards, open data, open source technology and knowledge modeling. We tested one such method that focuses on using behavior change techniques for the design phase, and tested OpenEHR and BPMN2 as the basis for the ICT platform to support the deployment phase.","","978-1-4673-7701-0","10.1109/WiMOB.2015.7347983","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7347983","eCare;interoperability;interventions;behavior change interventions;OpenEHR;BPMN2","Medical services;Object oriented modeling;Data models;Interoperability;Standards;Psychology;Business","","","","20","IEEE","7 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
