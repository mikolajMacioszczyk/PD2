"A presentation semantic for the Operational Data Model (ODM)","T. M. Deserno; D. Haak; M. Harmsen; S. Geisler; M.

However, ODM insufficiently supports visualization (e.g., dropdown vs. checkbox), layout (e.g., horizontal vs. vertical), and functionality (e.g., hiding of fields). In this work, the Operational Data Representation (ODR) is defined as a semi-formal specification language. ODR extends ODM by a presentation layer, whereby ODM is still used for data binding. As proof of concept, a software framework of ODR rendering engines is implemented on various devices (web, mobile applications, paper-based). A converter for OpenClinica eCRFs is developed to simplify ODR specification. Using ODR, a public repository of more than 4,000 ODM-based eCRFs is rendered correctly on all runtime systems. Therefore, ODR allows eCRF interchange across heterogeneous devices and systems on the visual and the functional level. It will simplify electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO).","","978-1-5090-4179-4","10.1109/BHI.2017.7897309","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7897309","","Runtime;Rendering (computer graphics);Visualization;Engines;HTML;Androids;Humanoid robots","","","","17","IEEE","13 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We discuss the NINDS requirements and how they influenced the system design, with an emphasis on dynamic form creation. We also evaluate open standards such as ""CDISC ODM"" and several database technology choices, namely conventional relational ""EAV"" tables and the new ""XMLDB"" from Oracle. We describe performance test results, which show that it is feasible to implement CDISC ODM in Oracle XMLDB and the schema-based storage option for storing XML content is better than ""CLOB""-based for applications that require high numbers of queries for XML fragments. For storage and retrieval of whole XML documents, CLOB storage is optimal. CSIS implements a hybrid approach of combining CLOB storage for storing XML documents with relational tables for storing metadata. Due to the complexity of the CDISC schema and related performance and implementation concerns, we have decided not to implement CDISC internal storage in our system.","1063-7125","0-7695-2104-5","10.1109/CBMS.2004.1311780","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1311780","","Informatics;Databases;XML;Protocols;Testing;Computer integrated manufacturing;Patient monitoring;Software architecture;Computer architecture;Web server","","1","","7","IEEE","19 Jul 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Generating User Interfaces from CDISC ODM for Mobile Devices","G. M. de Melo; J. Nagler-Ihlein; M.

Thus it becomes obvious that using mobile platforms and remote data entry is beneficial for such studies. When working in a distributed fashion, data exchange standards are required. Bringing these standards to the end user also requires incorporating user interface issues. Considering various device types, from desktop computer to small handheld devices raises the question how user interfaces could be derived from the data exchange standards. In this paper we consider CDISC's operational data model as a data standard and discuss its relevance in the user interface generation process. Several candidate description languages are explored and embedded into a general transformation process emphasizing especially small and mobile device characteristics.","1935-4908","978-0-7695-2595-2","10.1109/ICMB.2006.19","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4124125","","User interfaces;Handheld computers;Data models;Mobile computing;Informatics;Computer interfaces;Filling;Data analysis;Data handling;Microcomputers","","2","","10","IEEE","12 Mar 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
